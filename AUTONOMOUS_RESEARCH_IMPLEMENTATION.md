# 🧬 Autonomous Research Scientist Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive autonomous research system that enables your biomedical AI to conduct independent research just like a real scientist. The system follows the iterative research methodology you specified, with the AI working autonomously through research cycles while maintaining detailed logs and building a research library.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Autonomous Research Agent** (`src/autonomous_research_agent.py`)
The core agent that implements the 7-phase research loop:

1. **Problem Definition & Hypothesis Generation**
   - Analyzes research questions
   - Generates 2-3 initial hypotheses with mechanistic rationale
   - Focuses on muscle biology and sports performance

2. **Mechanistic Literature Review**
   - Searches local knowledge first (your 11GB+ data)
   - Falls back to external sources only when needed
   - Analyzes biological mechanisms and pathways
   - Identifies knowledge gaps

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**
   - Evaluates hypotheses against findings
   - Refines or generates new hypotheses based on evidence
   - Loops back to literature review if needed

4. **Experiment Design & Simulation**
   - Designs experiments to test hypotheses
   - Runs lightweight simulations when possible
   - Analyzes results to support/refute hypotheses

5. **Clinical Trial Design**
   - Creates detailed trial protocols
   - Includes safety monitoring and ethical considerations
   - Reviews and iterates on designs

6. **Innovation Proposal**
   - Generates creative solutions
   - Proposes new supplements, training protocols, etc.
   - Prioritizes by impact and feasibility

7. **Logging & Planning**
   - Creates comprehensive progress reports
   - Determines if another iteration is needed
   - Plans next research steps

### 2. **Research Logger** (`src/research_logger.py`)
Provides detailed hourly logging:

- **Hourly Updates**: Automatic logs every hour showing:
  - Recent actions taken
  - Key findings discovered
  - Current hypothesis being tested
  - Thought process and reasoning
  - Planned next steps

- **Human-Readable Format**: Logs are in Markdown for easy reading
- **Event Tracking**: Tracks all phase transitions and milestones
- **Export Capability**: Can export complete research logs

### 3. **Research Library** (`src/research_library.py`)
Manages research documents like a real lab:

- **Organized Sections**:
  - `/papers` - Literature reviews
  - `/protocols` - Trial designs
  - `/data` - Experiment results
  - `/findings` - Key discoveries
  - `/hypotheses` - Hypothesis documents
  - `/innovations` - Innovation proposals
  - `/reports` - Final reports

- **Indexing System**: Searchable by project, type, tags
- **Bibliography Generation**: Auto-creates citations
- **Export Projects**: Zip entire research projects

### 4. **Simulation Tools** (`src/simulation_tools.py`)
Lightweight simulations for testing hypotheses:

- **Training Response**: Models adaptation over time
- **Supplement Effects**: Simulates creatine, beta-alanine, etc.
- **Muscle Growth**: Hypertrophy response modeling
- **Fatigue Recovery**: Recovery dynamics
- **Dose-Response**: Optimal dosing calculations
- **Metabolic Adaptation**: VO2max, RMR changes

### 5. **GUI Integration**
Two new tabs in your interface:

#### 🧬 Autonomous Research Tab
- Start research with a question
- View live research logs
- Pause/resume research
- Export research projects

#### 📚 Research Library Tab
- Browse all research documents
- View project statistics
- Search documents by type
- Access complete research history

## 🚀 How To Use

### Starting Research
1. Go to the "🧬 Autonomous Research" tab
2. Enter a research question like:
   - "How can we improve muscle recovery after intense training?"
   - "What supplements enhance mitochondrial function?"
   - "How does sleep affect muscle protein synthesis?"
3. Optionally provide a project name
4. Click "Start Autonomous Research"

### What Happens Next
The AI will:
1. Generate initial hypotheses
2. Search your local knowledge base
3. Run simulations to test ideas
4. Design experiments and trials
5. Propose innovative solutions
6. Log progress every hour

### Viewing Progress
- **Live Log**: Updates every 30 seconds showing current phase
- **Hourly Updates**: Detailed progress reports
- **Status Display**: Shows current phase, iteration, findings
