# üõ†Ô∏è Research Engine Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong

1. **Research Engine Error**: The experimental research engine was calling `self.pharma_rag.retrieve(hypothesis, top_k=10)` but the `retrieve()` method doesn't accept a `top_k` parameter.

2. **pkg_resources Warning**: Gradio was showing a deprecation warning about pkg_resources.

## What We Fixed

### 1. Fixed Research Engine (src/experimental_research_engine.py)
Changed:
```python
# Before:
evidence = self.pharma_rag.retrieve(hypothesis, top_k=10)

# After:
evidence = self.pharma_rag.retrieve(hypothesis)
```

### 2. Suppressed pkg_resources Warning (src/gui_unified.py)
Added warning suppression:
```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message=".*pkg_resources is deprecated.*")
```

## How to Use Research Mode Properly

The research mode should now work when you ask the AI to do research. Try these examples:

1. **Direct research request:**
   ```
   "Research ways to enhance creatine effectiveness"
   "Research optimal muscle recovery strategies"
   "Research longevity interventions"
   ```

2. **Using the word "research" triggers the mode:**
   - "Do research on creatine and what could enhance it"
   - "Can you research new supplement combinations?"
   - "Research the latest findings on beta-alanine"

## What to Expect

When research mode activates:
1. You'll see "üî¨ Research Mode Activated!"
2. It will generate hypotheses
3. Search your 11GB knowledge base
4. Run simulations where applicable
5. Generate innovations
6. Take 1-3 minutes to complete

## Important Notes

- The system loads everything through the GUI to avoid memory issues
- Don't run research scripts directly - use the GUI
- The research is now using your local knowledge base properly
- Each research session is logged to `experimental_research/research_log.md`

## If Issues Persist

1. Restart the application: `./start_optimized.command`
2. Make sure you have built the indexes (run training if needed)
3. Check that you have enough free RAM (at least 5GB)
4. Try simpler research questions first

The research engine should now work properly through the GUI!
