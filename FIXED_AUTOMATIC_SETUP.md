# ‚úÖ Fixed: Everything is Now Automatic!

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- You had to manually run `python switch_performance_mode.py optimized`
- Then restart with `./start_optimized.command`
- Multiple steps to get GPU acceleration

### Now:
- **Just run `./start_optimized.command`**
- First run automatically enables GPU acceleration
- No manual commands needed!

## How It Works

1. **First Run Detection**
   ```bash
   ./start_optimized.command
   ```
   - Detects no `active_config.json`
   - Automatically copies `m1_optimized_config.json`
   - Sets up 24 GPU layers
   - Enables Metal acceleration
   - You see: "‚úÖ First run detected - applying M1 optimized configuration..."

2. **Every Run After**
   - Remembers your settings
   - Shows current mode
   - Applies correct environment variables

## Test Results

```
‚úÖ Active config exists
‚úÖ Optimized mode is active
‚úÖ GPU layers set to 24
‚úÖ M1 optimized config template exists
‚úÖ API integration files present
```

## Your Simple Workflow

### Today:
```bash
./start_optimized.command
```
That's it! GPU acceleration happens automatically.

### In the GUI:
1. Click **Advanced Tools**
2. Toggle **üåê Enable Live API Data**
3. Start asking questions!

### Try These:
- "What are the latest clinical trials on creatine?"
- "Research muscle recovery strategies"
- "Show me recent beta-alanine studies"

## No More Manual Steps!

You DON'T need to:
- ‚ùå Run performance mode commands (automatic)
- ‚ùå Configure GPU settings (automatic)
- ‚ùå Set up configs (automatic)
- ‚ùå Remember complex commands (there aren't any!)

Everything is optimized automatically for your M1 MacBook Pro! üéâ
